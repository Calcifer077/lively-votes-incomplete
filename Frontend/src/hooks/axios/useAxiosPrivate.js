// How it works?
// In the earlier version we used refresh token interceptors in apiConfig file.
// But we needed to also access react features (hooks) only setting localstorage wouldn't work.
// So we created this custom hook. so that we can access react features (like navigate from react-router, dispatch function, context).
// We took the original version of axios which is still responsible for making request and added interceptors to it.
// There are basically two types of interceptors, one for request and one for response.
// Request is attached before every request and response works after we get some kind of response.
// Before making request we add jwt from context api, which is required for most requests.
// In case of 401 error which means that the token has expired, we will try to refetch the token using refresh token stored in cookies.
// Token will be used by backend from cookies on its own, we don't have to do anything.
// In case of any other errors user will be navigated to login page.

// Now there is a problem with our api.
// All the api which connects to the backend are not custom hooks, but if they need to use the functinalities of this hook, they will have to use useAxiosPrivate.
// To achieve this we will pass useAxiosPrivate hook in their parameters.
// All the api functions are called by tanstack query, so we can simply pass useAxiosPrivate hook in their parameters.

// Everything except login, signup use this hook, so in those cases we will just use the original axios instance.
